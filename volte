What are the benefits of VoLTE?
Fast call set-up.
High voice quality and reduced background noise.
The phone remains in the 4G/LTE network during voice calls.
You can use 4G/LTE data services, such as web surfing and tethering, while simultaneously making and receiving calls.
When calling over LTE, you don't use extra data but call minutes. You pay for the voice call service, not the data you use.
Smooth transition between VoWiFi and VoLTE
If you leave the Wi-Fi range during a Wi-Fi call (VoWiFi), your smartphone will automatically switch to VoLTE (Voice over data) and the call will continue. 
However, this will only happen if 4G/LTE is selected as Network mode on your phone and if youâ€™re within the range of a 4G/LTE network.
This transition is not possible when calling over Wi-Fi with a separate app such as Skype, WhatsApp, etc.
